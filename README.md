## What is this?

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project to translate input text from the video game 2XKO from Riot games, since most of players share "combos" with a specific notation used by the community. I've made this tool to make easier to share this information for new players.

## Functions:

- Able to read a translation in text of the inputs
- Able to visualize the translation in icons
- Able to generate PNG file of the translated input
- In the future able to share the combo through a share code


## How to run this locally

Clone the repo

Install dependencies with ```npm install``` or equivalent

Then run the server with:
```bash
npm run dev
```
or equivalent command.

This app is deployed at vercel, check the DEMO here:
